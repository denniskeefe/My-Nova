# My Nova Project

This site will be used to document the restoration of my 1972 Chevy Nova. I will have the help of my two teen boys, who will help with the repairs, as well as shooting photos, video and helping maintain this site.

I think this will be a great opportunity to connect with my boys in two totally different areas of technical skills. My goal is to bond with my boys and create lasting memories.

This project will begin 9/1/2013
